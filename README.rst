Strings Library
***************

This is a strings library for Dylan providing common string and
character functions.

It was initially described in `DEP-0004
<http://opendylan.org/proposals/dep-0004.html>`_.

It is documented within the `Open Dylan Library Reference
<http://opendylan.org/documentation/library-reference/>`_.

It is distributed with Open Dylan releases starting with
version 2012.1. It is incorporated into the Open Dylan
git repository via a submodule, so changes here should
result an update to the Open Dylan repository to use the
new version.
